Changed:
    added ability to use Openssl to generate certs on the fly
        stored in certs/
    changed powershell window to hidden after execution
    changed the banner since one of the letters looked like something else
    added  -WindowStyle Hidden to the payload to hide the ps window after execution
    changed the name of the X-hoax-id header to X-Requested-With --> need to make this a user definable option from a cmd line param or config file


TODO:
    change the hoaxshell> prompt to the working dir
        Attempted to do this by having:
            pwd | OutDefault; <user_input>
        if the user selected to, but the current code cuts everything before the pipe out
        Little time was spent on this and I need to figure out how to do it properly

    Implement a way to allow users to choose the name for the X-hoax-id
    Implement features to create malleable profiles similar to Cobalt Strike
        Allow for customization of the traffic to evade detection
    Allow for randomization of http request from set list
